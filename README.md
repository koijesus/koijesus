Hey everyone, I'm KoiJesus. You might know me as Kye if you know me.
I'm a year one comp sci major, a writer, and a content creator.
Right now I have big ambitions for a new kind of dating app. More on that in the future.
My ambitions for computer science come from multiple facets in my life,
My father, my godfather, and many different YouTube creators, including Linus Sebastion and the rest of LMG.
That's about all I have right now, hopefully you'll hear more from me one day. :)
